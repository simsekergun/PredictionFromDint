# Prediction From Integrated Dispersion Data

Note: In this study, we assume a random noise which is proportional to integrated dispersion measurements. In another study, we will assume totally random noise later.

Predicting ring dimensions and Sellmeier model from integrated dispersion datasets.


We consider a microring resonator composed of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as the core material and SiO<sub>2</sub> as the cladding. The outer ring radius is fixed at $23~\mu$m, while the waveguide height and width are varied to construct a comprehensive dataset for dispersion analysis. Specifically, the height is swept from $620$~nm to $720$~nm in increments of $5$~nm, and the width is swept from $750$~nm to $950$~nm in increments of $10$~nm, resulting in $441$ unique training designs. In addition, we generate a test dataset by randomly selecting $50$ distinct integer widthâ€“height combinations (in nanometers) from the same ranges as the training dataset.


To accurately capture material dispersion, we employ wavelength-dependent relative permittivity models for both Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ({https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-46-23-5970})and SiO<sub>2</sub> ({https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309397004389}).
