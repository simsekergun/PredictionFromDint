Predicting ring dimensions and Sellmeier model from integrated dispersion datasets.


We consider a microring resonator composed of Si$_3$N$_4$ as the core material and SiO$_2$ as the cladding. The outer ring radius is fixed at $23~\mu$m, while the waveguide height and width are varied to construct a comprehensive dataset for dispersion analysis. Specifically, the height is swept from $620$~nm to $720$~nm in increments of $5$~nm, and the width is swept from $750$~nm to $950$~nm in increments of $10$~nm, resulting in $441$ unique training designs. In addition, we generate a test dataset by randomly selecting $50$ distinct integer widthâ€“height combinations (in nanometers) from the same ranges as the training dataset.


To accurately capture material dispersion, we employ wavelength-dependent relative permittivity models for both Si<sub>3</sub>$N$_4$ ({https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-46-23-5970})and SiO$_2$ ({https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309397004389}).
